âœ… Task 2 Completed!
 I conducted data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. This involved handling missing values, analyzing key variables, and uncovering relationships and patterns within the data.
 EDA is a critical step that provides meaningful insights and sets the stage for effective, informed decision-making in any data-driven project.
 On to the next challenge! ðŸ’¡ðŸ“Š
